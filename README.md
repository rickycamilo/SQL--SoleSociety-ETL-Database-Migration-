# SQL--SoleSociety-ETL-Database-Migration-

SoleSociety is an up-and-coming online sneaker boutique with small warehouse locations spread across a few countries. They have seen enough business growth to warrant moving their business data from a flat spreadsheet with multiple tabs to a database.  This project aims to streamline and optimize the data management process for SoleSociety. By transferring their business data from a local spreadsheet to a PostgreSQL database. Upon completion, this ETL project will provide us with enhanced data reliability, improved data access for faster decision-making, scalability to accommodate our growth, and the capability to perform advanced analytics.

We will use python packages psycopg2 and pandas to create a database for SoleSociety as well as extract the data from its native excel format, transform the data as to correct any errors/ clean it up, and then load the data onto the tables that will comprise the SoleSociety database. We will then run through a few SQL queries to answer some business questions that the SoleSociety admin team have.
